Importing Libraries:

python

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyaudio
import pywhatkit
import os

    speech_recognition: This library is used for recognizing speech input.
    pyaudio: This library provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross-platform audio library. It's used for handling audio input/output.
    pywhatkit: This library allows various automation tasks such as playing YouTube videos.
    os: This module provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.

Recognizer Initialization

python

listen1 = sr.Recognizer()

    Creates an instance of the Recognizer class from the speech_recognition library to recognize speech.

Listening to the Microphone

python

with sr.Microphone() as myorder:
    print("I am listening ...")
    myvoice = listen1.listen(myorder)

    The with sr.Microphone() as myorder statement sets up the microphone for listening.
    listen1.listen(myorder) captures the audio from the microphone and stores it in myvoice.

Recognizing and Processing the Command

python

    mycommand = listen1.recognize_google(myvoice)
    mycommand = mycommand.lower()
    print(mycommand)

    recognize_google(myvoice) converts the captured audio to text using Google Web Speech API.
    mycommand.lower() converts the recognized command to lowercase to ensure uniformity in further checks.
    print(mycommand) outputs the recognized command to the console for debugging.

Executing Commands

python

    if ("notepad") in mycommand:
        os.system('notepad')
    if('computer') in mycommand:
        mycommand=mycommand.replace("computer",'')
        if("play" in mycommand):
            mycommand=mycommand.replace("play",'')
            pywhatkit.playonyt(mycommand)

    First if block: Checks if the word "notepad" is in the recognized command. If it is, it opens Notepad using the os.system command.
    Second if block:
        Checks if the word "computer" is in the recognized command.
        If "computer" is found, it removes "computer" from the command string.
        Nested if block:
            Checks if the word "play" is in the remaining command string.
            If "play" is found, it removes "play" from the command string.
            Uses pywhatkit.playonyt(mycommand) to play the remaining command as a YouTube search term.

Example Usage

    If you say "open notepad", Notepad will open.
    If you say "computer play some music", it will search and play "some music" on YouTube.

This script essentially acts as a simple voice-activated assistant that can open Notepad or play videos on YouTube based on specific voice commands.
